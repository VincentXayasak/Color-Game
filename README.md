# Color-Game
Color Game is a game where the player has to correctly answer as many colors shown before the time limit runs out with all of the high scoring players being kept in memory. First, players have a choice for their name and their time limit allowing for any type of input from the sophisticated regular expression algorithms. Then, the player gets a GUI window for the game where the player presses the Enter key to start the game in the game: a word shows up with a certain color. The player types in the color of the word and will try to correctly type in many correct colors as possible before their time is up. The player gets a score of correct color identifications and will be stored in memory if it is a high score.
